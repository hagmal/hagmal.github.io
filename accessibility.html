                The first test told us that the images needed explicit width and height, but our images have relative size. 
                It also said that the HTML element did not have a “lang” element. We did have that, but it was placed in “head”. 
                We therefore changed it and placed it in the HTML tag. At SEO we scored 90 because we did not have a meta description. 
                SEO stands for “search engine optimization” and this means to increase visibility in Google, Microsoft Bing etc. 
                We thought that SEO would have a low score because we have used lorem ipsum in some of the pages, but that does not seem to be the case.

            <h3>
                Second lighthouse-test

            <!--added this scroll container so people can decide if they want to review the pictures or keep scrolling-->

            </p>
            <p>
                 In the second test we tested both with desktop- and mobile-mode. We still have the problems with width and height on pictures. 
                But at the mobile-mode-test we have received lower in performance than in the desktop-mode. The reason for this is that we have elements 
                on our website that makes the page load slower, among other things the image-sizing. We therefore tried to change our images from JPEG and PNG to WebP, 
                which made the performance-score better in mobile-mode and even better in desktop-mode, as you can see in the pictures below. We asked the TA’s about “eliminate render-blocking resources” and they 
                told us that it is not in the syllabus, therefore we did not do anything about that.

                We used a website called coolors.co to create a color-palette for our website. This palette has a good mixture of colors that we feel will fit our website 
                and distinguish our design. Moreover, the color-palette provide good visibility and contrast which makes the website user-friendly. At coolors.co we can also 
                see what the colors will look like for those who suffer from color blindness. Because the theme for this exam is OsloMet, the color green is suitable. 
                The color green symbolizes progress, hope, youth and harmony, which is something that we think OsloMet is representing. 
            </p>  
            <p>
                Our main page gives an introduction to our website. With a big picture of the OsloMet-campus, the reader will know what the theme of the website is. 
                At the bottom of the page we have a picture-roll. The thought behind this was to be able to show more pictures, but with minimal space. That way the reader 
                can chose for themselves if they want to scroll through the pictures or not. The same goes for our “Accessibility” page. The pages “The P35 canteen” and “Accessibility” 
                has the same design as the front page, to show the connection between the pages on the website.
