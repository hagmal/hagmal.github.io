                <i> "In a world progressively relying on digital tools and information,
                your future professions increasingly require the responsibility and capacity to stop and think."</i>
            </p>
            <p>
                It's easier not to think, so that AI and machines can do things for you. Thinking is a muscle that needs to be trained, 
                so if you don't think it will eventually stop working. If you stop thinking, you can just get a machine to code for you, 
                and then you won't need the people anymore. It is therefore important to think that you are responsible for what you make and better. 
                This means that you must be able to think through the possible consequences of what you create. We therefore agree with this statement.

                What, in your opinion, is the difference between meaning and knowledge/facts?
            </p>
            <p>    
                An opinion is subjective and personal. Facts and knowledge are black and white and set. Opinions are more in the gray areas, it is not a set fact. 
                With opinions you talk about something in relation to something else, but facts are truth in themselves and are provable, they are objective. 
                Facts today are not necessarily facts in the future. For example, it used to be thought that the earth was flat and this was a fact, but today we know that it is round and now this is a fact. 
                A bit like Kant's "Ding an sich" and "ding fur mich", that meaning becomes more the world as we experience it and truth as the world as it is.

                Can or will computers be able to think? What could be the positive and negative consequences if they could?
            </p>
            <p>    
                Considering the way thinking was described in the lecture in DATA1100, artificial intelligence/machines today can think. If you give the machine goals to evaluate ethically, it will do so. 
                But it doesn't think the way humans think. We humans have several goals at the same time, which can also collide with each other, but machines only have one goal it wants to prioritize. 
                Emotions also affect the thought process of humans, and machines do not have emotions. If you ask the machine the same question today and tomorrow, you will get the same answer. 
                But if you ask people the same question today and tomorrow, you might get different answers, depending on their feelings, etc. We don't think it's easy to make a machine feel and acquire its own judgments. 
                In that case it will be scary, because then we humans have no control over it.

                <i>Positive consequences</i> if machines could think are that we humans get quick answers to things. If you have a thinking machine, you have a good tool for learning, discussing with the machine.

                <i>Negative consequences</i> if machines can think, then humans will stop thinking and become worse at it. We would also become even more dependent on the internet and machines. It's easier to ask a machine for thoughts than itself, 
                and you'll get faster answers. Humans will probably also have less patience. If you wish to learn more about the negative concequences of AI,
